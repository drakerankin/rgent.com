		<p> 	Im Drake J. Rankin, CEO and founder of RGENT Games, as well as game engineering. I am dedicated to making sure we produce the best content possible as well as making sure we can keep this group together while continuing to hire and expand. My goal for Rgent is to eventually become one of the bigger game development companies in the world and keep the same  people we have right now as a major part of what we are going to do in the future. The key for me as a leader is unity and fun, I firmly believe if we don't have fun, we will not produce excellent content, and thats what we strive to do every single day!</p>

		<p> My name is Jackie McIntosh and I'm the one of the concept artists for RGENT. I'm in charge of all character design for the company. I'm hoping to be able to develop my skills as well as growing with the company. I'm super excited for what lies ahead! </p>

		<p> I'm Erykah B. Edora, Head Animator for RGENT Games. I'm currently a sophomore in high school and have been doing digital art for over four years now and have been drawing since I picked up a pencil. I plan on using my skills for RGENT with my four friends for however long we keep working together for the best of RGENT. Drake's dedication inspired me-and I'm sure the others as well-to aim to be as dedicated as he is and help make RGENT expand and succeed. Being a part of this group is definitely a lot of fun and I know that my skills combined with everyone else's will help lead to RGENT producing great content and loads of fun for everyone.  </p>

		<p> I'm Lindsey Lubin, Head Environmental Artist on the RGENT crew. I'm self-taught artist who is constantly trying to improve my art. I joined this project in hopes of expanding my range of skills and as well as building up connections. I know that everything I learn from this experience will help me become a more experienced and well rounded artist.	</p>

		<p>  I'm Matthew Elliott and I am the COO and Manager of Social Media Operations for RGENT.  I'm in charge of making sure all  projects are done in a timely manner and are completed to the best of our workers' abilities.  I started working for RGENT because I trust our CEO's ability to run this company and I am absolutely positive that this company will be doing big things and going great places. </p>

		<p> My name is Alenna Del Rosario and I'm one of the game engineers at RGENT. Our company continues to grow and improve every day. Being part of the team has provided us all with many opportunities. Personally, it has presented me with the opportunity to enhance my programming abilities. It is an exciting experience and I'm looking forward to what lies ahead.  </p>

		<p> Hello, I'm Milan Gallegos and I hold the position of Assistant Creative Director within the ranks of Rankin Gaming Entertainment. Drake Rankin and I have been friends since early childhood and I'm glad to work with him and the RGENT team today. I'm here to see the creative concept of all RGENT productions through and to make sure that the team doesn't stray too far from the original vision for each project. With our current work on “Help” it would seem we're headed in the right direction!  </p>
